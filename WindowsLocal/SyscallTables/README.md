# Usage

1) Dump syscall table list (using scg for ntoskrnl or wscg64 for win32k), see run examples for more info.  
2) [Tables] <- put syscall list text file named as build number inside directory (ntos subdirectory for ntoskrnl.exe tables, win32k subdirectory for win32k.sys tables);

3) sstc.exe <- run composer with key -t (generate text output file) or -h (generate html output file), it will read files from Tables directory and compose output table. Specify -w as second param if you want to generate win32k combined syscall table.

Run Examples:
* scg64.exe c:\wfiles\ntdll\ntdll_7600.dll > table7600.txt 
* wscg64.exe c:\wfiles\win32k\10240\win32k.sys > wtable10240.txt
* sstc -t -w
* sstc -h
